# Design-of-CNT-based-Vacuum-Transistor

- This research project was conducted under the guidelines of Prof.Ivan Puchdes at RIT which was not part of course work in Summer 2019.
- The vacuum is used as the channel medium to reduce the collision of electrons.
- The main goal to perform this experiment is to get a higher saturation current and lower threshold voltage by reducing channel length modulation. 
- For the distance between anode and cathode to 3 nm, the threshold voltage observed is 0.4V, and also 50% higher saturation current was observed.
- This project contains all simulation performance on COMSOL software.
